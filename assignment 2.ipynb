LV ventriculography demonstrated a preserved left ventricular\\n\\nfunction with an ejection fraction of approximately 65%.  The\\nmitral\\nvalve did not demonstrate any evidence of any valvular\\nregurgitation.\\nThere was no significant pressure gradient across the aortic\\nvalve upon\\npullback from the left ventricle to the aorta.\\n3.

[**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-7-6**] for further\\nevaluation of her chest pain. She underwent a cardiac\\ncatheterization which revealed three vessel disease. Given the\\nseverity of her disease, the cardiac surgical servive was\\nconsulted for surgical evaluation. She was worked-up in the\\nusual preoperative manner. The hepatology service was consulted\\nfor evaluation of surgical risk given her hepatitis. She was\\nclassified as a Child's score A cirrhotic and cleared for\\nsurgery. The hematology service was consulted given her\\nleukocytopenia however it was felt that this was mild,\\nlongstanding and related to her hepatitis. On [**2190-7-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname **].\\n[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she underwent off\\npump coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see\\noperative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the\\nCSRU for monitoring. She latera awoke neurologically intact and\\nwas extubated. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] was\\ntransferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was\\ngently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical\\ntherapy service was consulted for assistance with her\\npostoperative strength and mobility.

The patient\\nrequired persistent ventilator support. His vent settings were\\nchanged for ARDS treatment, specifically pressure control with\\nreduced tidal volumes (goal 450), reduced driving pressure (goal\\n14). The patient required high FiO2 (60%) to maintain his oxygen\\npressure. He was continued on high dose steroids. The patient's\\nIV access from the outside hospital was removed and the patient\\nunderwent right IJ line placement as well A-Line placement.\\n.\\nThe [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a pneumothorax.\\nIt is unknown if the pneumothorax was due to prior trauma (the\\npatient had a pneumothorax at the OSH prior to admission), a\\ncomplication from central line placement or volu/[**Doctor Last Name **] trauma\\nfrom mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent chest tube\\nplacement with successful reduction of his pneumothorax. The\\npatient had a persistent air leak from the right sided chest\\ntube. The patient required large doses of sedation and continued\\nto have dyssynchrony from the vent. The patient failed a trial\\nof APRV. Ultimately the patient showed no improvements in his\\nrespiratory status. Upon dicussion with the family it became\\nclear that the patient's wish was to never be ventilator\\ndependent for any protracted period of time (by the family's\\naccount, the patient specifically stated a desire for no\\nmechanical ventilation beyond 2 days). In accordance with the\\npatient's stated wishes prior to intubation as well as the\\nfamily's wishes, the patient was extubated on [**2158-6-29**]. He\\nexpired within 2 hours of extubation.\\n.\\nOf note, the patient had 1+ GNR on gram stain of his sputum and\\nout of concern for a possible ventilator-associate pneumonia he\\nwas started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Ultimately sputum\\ncultures grew only oropharyngeal flora. In addition, the patient\\ngrew coag negative staph - a likely contaminent - in 1 out of 4\\nbottles of blood from his A-line.\\n\\nDischarge Disposition:\\nExpired\\n\\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nARDS\\n\\n\\nDischarge Condition:\\nExpired\\n\\n\\nDischarge Instructions:\\nNone\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nNone\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"LABLE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 280,\n        \"max\": 280,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          280\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entites\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1463,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Allergies', 'Codeine', 'Chest Pain', 'cirrhosis', 'vascular\\\\ndisease', '3-vessel\\\\ndisease', 'cirrhosis', 'liver decompensation', 'CAD', 'Diabetes mellitus Type II', 'HTN', 'GERD', 'Rheumatic Fever\\\\n\\\\n', 'disability', 'CAD', 'acute distress', 'thyromegaly', 'murmurs', 'hepato-', 'splenomegaly', 'inguinal lymphadenopathy', 'edema', 'clubbing', 'cyanosis', 'jaundice', 'pallor', 'CO2', 'vessel coronary artery disease', 'hypertension', 'atrial septal defect', 'ventricular wall thickness', 'atheroma', 'aortic regurgitation', 'ascites', 'chest pain', 'vessel disease', 'hepatitis', 'leukocytopenia', 'hepatitis', 'Prevacid', 'Zestril', 'Lisinopril', 'Prozac', 'Aspirin', 'Lorazepam', 'anxiety', 'Furosemide', 'Tablet(s', 'Metoprolol Tartrate', 'Tablet(s', 'Potassium Chloride 10 mEq Capsule', 'Q12H', 'Aspirin', 'pain', 'Prevacid', 'Delayed Release(E.C.', 'Delayed Release(E.C.)
